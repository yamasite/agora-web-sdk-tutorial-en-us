# Agora RTC Web SDK 4.x Tutorial

## Overview

This repo includes tutorials for Agora RTC Web SDK 4.x.

Agora RTC Web SDK is a client-side JavaScript SDK for real-time video/audio communication through desktop and mobile browsers. Compared with directly using WebRTC for real-time media communication, Agora RTC Web SDK provides encoding/decoding and transmission services by using SD-RTN<sup>TM</sup>, thus saving you the effort of building signaling, STUN, and TURN servers.

## Objectives

You can learn basic and advanced features of the Agora RTC Web SDK, together with some video/audio programming knowledge. You can also learn to use the SDK to build a typical video chat app.

## References

Agora provides technical documentation of the Web SDK. See [Start a Video Call (Web SDK 4.x)](https://docs.agora.io/en/Video/start_call_web_ng?platform=Web).
