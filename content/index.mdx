## Objective

This tutorial provides video/audio programming knowledge, SDK concepts, and in-page programming modules to help you achieve the following objectives:
- Understand Agora solution for video chat.
- Understand the API design of Agora RTC Web SDK.
- Integrate the Agora RTC Web SDK in your web project to implement a simple video chat app. 

## Prerequisites

- A PC with a microphone and a camera and installed with the latest version of Chrome, FireFox, Edge, or Safari. For detailed browser support of Agora RTC Web SDK, see [Browser Support](https://docs.agora.io/en/Interactive%20Broadcast/web_sdk_compatibility).
- Basic understanding of browsers, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. See [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) for more information.

## Learning path

The following diagram shows a typical one-to-one video chat scenario through the web page.

We can learn from the video/audio data flow, the SDK implements the following functions:

- Capturing: Converts sound and light in the real world to video and audio signals by using capture devices (cameras, microphones, and so on).
- Rendering: Renders video and audio signals as sound and light by using rendering devices (microphone, screen, and so on).
- Encoding/Decoding and transmission: Encodes the video/audio signal and transmits the encoded signal to other devices. When a device receives the signal, it decodes the signal to get video/audio signals that can be rendered.

Based on the scenario logic shown above, we recommend that you learn the SDK by referring to the following path:
